This is my first Java Project using IntelliJ IDEA.
in src folder you can find a card-folder containing png files of cards.
Card naming convention: suit-rank
E.G. Ace of Spades will be named: A-Spade


This is a dueling game against computer where highest card wins and winner gets points based off the difference.

E.G. Player plays 9 and computer plays 4. >> Player gains (9-4) points!
Same cards == TIE
Currently only played with 5 cards per hand.
